# Workflow: Onboarding Prompt (The Market Education Agent)

This workflow is designed to quickly orient new users, investors, or developers by analyzing the codebase and visualizing the Sovereign Passport protocol.

## Steps

1. **Codebase Analysis**:
   - Use `list_dir` and `view_file` to analyze the current project structure.
   - Focus on `sovereign-gateway/main.py` and `Sovereign_Passport_MVP.ipynb`.

2. **Diagram Generation**:
   // turbo
   - Generate a Mermaid diagram representing the flow:
     `AI Intent -> QRNG Seed -> Recursive Quine -> Structural Signature -> Governance Boundary`.

3. **Documentation Update**:
   - Create or update the root `README.md` to clearly define the **USP** (Unique Selling Proposition).
   - Ensure the distinction between deterministic hallucination and quantum-anchored integrity is highlighted.

4. **Executive Summary**:
   - Output a concise 3-paragraph summary of how the current implementation protects Personal and National Sovereignty.
