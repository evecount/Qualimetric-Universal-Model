# Technical README: The Quantum Passport Protocol (MVP v1.0)

## Overview

This repository/notebook contains the functional MVP for the **Quantum Passport**, a core implementation of the **Qualimetric Universal Model (QUM)**. It demonstrates how to anchor AI-to-API communication in a hardware-rooted, non-deterministic truth to protect Personal and National Sovereignty.

## The Problem: The "Ghost in the Machine"

In modern agentic AI architectures, there is no way to verify if an AI’s "intent" has been tampered with or if it has "hallucinated" an unauthorized backend call. Traditional software keys are deterministic and vulnerable to quantum brute-force.

## The Solution: The USP (Unique Selling Proposition)

Our approach moves the "Root of Trust" from the software layer to the physical layer using two proprietary mechanisms:

1. **Polynomial Method Index (PMI)**: Quantifies qualitative AI intent into a mathematical structure.
2. **Recursive Quine Algorithm**: A self-referential engine that binds the PMI structure to a **Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG)** seed.

## Core Components of the MVP

- **Quantum Entropy Anchor**: Pulls real-time, non-deterministic seeds from a QPU-linked API (simulating our hardware-rooted truth).
- **The Passport Issuance**: Demonstrates the **Recursive Quine** logic, where the algorithm produces a signature that contains the logic of its own creation.
- **Governance Boundary Verification**: A simulation of the **Stage 4 GraphQL Gateway** (from our Architecture Overview) that validates passports before allowing backend access.

## Why this protects Sovereignty

### Integrity Arbitrage

By issuing a unique "Quantum Passport" for every request, we ensure that no agent can act without a verifiable, hardware-anchored audit trail.

### Non-Repudiation

Because the signature is tied to a QRNG seed, it cannot be spoofed or replayed, even by a quantum computer.
