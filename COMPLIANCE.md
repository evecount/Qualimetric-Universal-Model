# Sovereign Integrity Compliance (v1.0)

**Standard**: Qualimetric Universal Model (QUM)
**Certification**: Sovereign Passport Protocol

## Compliance Framework: AI-to-Backend Governance

This document certifies that the current implementation meets the requirements for **Sovereign Integrity Compliance**, specifically protecting against "Governance Gaps" in agentic AI architectures.

### 1. Hardware Anchor Compliance (QRNG-101)

- **Requirement**: Authorization tokens must be generated from a non-deterministic physical source.
- **Implementation**: Baseline establishes a `uint16` entropy pulse from the ANU Quantum RNG API for every passport issued.
- **Status**: **PASSED**

### 2. Structural Symmetry Compliance (Q-Quine)

- **Requirement**: The signature must be a self-referential map of the qualitative "AI Intent."
- **Implementation**: Every API call features a **Structural Signature** generated via the **Recursive Quine Algorithm**.
- **Status**: **PASSED**

### 3. Non-Repudiation Compliance

- **Requirement**: Actions cannot be replayed or spoofed by centralized software entities.
- **Implementation**: The **Governance Boundary** enforces a unique-entropy check (Replay Protection) for every incoming request.
- **Status**: **PASSED**

### 4. Deterministic Risk Mitigation

- **Requirement**: Mitigation of "Hallucination" risks in autonomous agents.
- **Implementation**: **Integrity Arbitrage**—automatic rejection of any request where the execution payload deviates from the signed intent.
- **Status**: **PASSED**

## Declaration of Sovereignty

By adopting this protocol, the entity ensures that its AI agents operate within a **Secure Governance Boundary**, where identity and intent are anchored in physical truth rather than software estimation.
