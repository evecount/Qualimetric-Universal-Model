# Qualimetric Universal Model (QUM)

## Overview

> ### **MINTING QUANTUM TOKENS**  
>
> ### **FOR REAL**
>
> This repository demonstrates the world's first protocol for forging non-deterministic digital assets directly from physical quantum entropy.

**Eve Count** has developed the **Qualimetric Universal Model (QUM)** for enterprise-grade data integrity and systemic auditing. The product applies a **Polynomial Method Index (PMI)** and a **Recursive Quine Algorithm** to quantify qualitative variables and ensure hardware-rooted truth via **Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG)**, allowing for high-fidelity auditing in complex, non-deterministic environments.

This repository contains the MVP for the **Sovereign Passport**, a core component of the QUM ecosystem.

## Key Components

### 1. Quantum-Secured Sovereign Trust Layer

The foundational infrastructure for the QUM protocol. It acts as the "Standard for Truth," utilizing live quantum entropy streams to anchor digital identities and intents to physical reality.

### 2. Real-World Quantum Tokenization

Every authenticated action within the QUM ecosystem is a uniquely minted **'Quantum Token'**. Unlike traditional tokens, these are backed by the non-deterministic truth of quantum hardware, creating a new class of **physics-anchored assets** with infinite utility—from autonomous finance to jurisdictional evidence logs.

## The USP: Recursive Quine Algorithm

### Agentic Workflows

The repository is also equipped with **Agentic Workflows** (located in `.agent/workflows/`) that enable AI agents to:

- **/onboarding**: Analyze the project and explain the Sovereign Passport.
- **/setup**: Prepare the environment for Sovereign Integrity hooks.
- **/audit**: Perform a 'Structural Signature' audit on existing services.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library

## Revenue Generation Model

Based on successful quantum and deep-tech startup benchmarks, QUM operates on a hybrid revenue model:

- **Licensing & IP Monetization**: Upfront fees ($100k–$500k) plus 5–10% royalties for the **Recursive Quine Algorithm** and **PMI framework**.
- **Integrity-as-a-Service (SaaS)**: Recurring subscription model for ongoing systemic auditing and "Structural Signature" verification.
- **Strategic Consulting**: High-value integration services ($2k–$5k/day) for complex dataset diagnostics and quantum-safe transitions.

## Ideal Customer Profile

- **Enterprise AI Architects**: Teams building agentic workflows who need a **"Governance Boundary"** to prevent AI hallucinations or unauthorized backend access.
- **Regulated Financial Institutions**: Banks and insurance providers requiring **Integrity Arbitrage** and hardware-rooted audit trails for high-frequency transactions.
- **Government & Defense Agencies**: Entities needing to secure sensitive API pipelines against **"Harvest Now, Decrypt Later"** threats using Quantum-Safe signatures.
- **Life Sciences & Healthcare Providers**: Researchers dealing with complex, qualitative datasets who require **Systemic Diagnostics** to ensure the integrity of diagnostic predictions.
- **Cybersecurity Operations Centers (SOCs)**: Organizations looking to replace predictable RNGs with QRNG-secured **"Structural Signatures"** to eliminate replay attacks.

## Integrating Quantum Tech into API Pipelines

To ensure AI never communicates directly with backend services, we integrate the QRNG-based Structural Signature into the **Quantum-Secured Sovereign Trust Layer**:

| Method | Implementation Strategy | Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Entropy Injection** | Use a QRNG daemon to feed `/dev/urandom` on API servers. | Existing TLS/SSL session keys become quantum-safe without code changes. |
| **Middleware Auth** | Implement a custom GraphQL directive requiring a QRNG-signed token for sensitive mutations. | Ensures every backend write is validated by a non-deterministic hardware root of truth. |
| **REST/gRPC Wrapper** | Use the QRNG Open API to wrap legacy backend calls with a "Structural Signature." | Prevents deterministic "replay attacks" on legacy backend services. |

## 5-10 Year Vision

To establish the QUM framework as the global standard for **Quantum-Safe Data Integrity and Asset Minting**. We aim to move beyond simple RNG replacement to becoming the primary "structural audit" layer and **"Token Forge"** for all agentic AI architectures, ensuring that as AI scales, every decision it makes is a verifiable, quantum-secured asset with real-world economic value.

## Deep-Dive: Stage 4 & 5 Integration

Based on our architecture model, here is the granular integration path:

### At the Governance Boundary (Stage 4)

- **The Integration**: Use QRNG to generate **"Structural Signatures"** for every request passing through the **Quantum-Secured Sovereign Trust Layer** (formerly GraphQL Gateway).
- **The Why**: This ensures that the "Validate & Authorize" step is not just checking a password, but verifying a quantum-unique token that cannot be predicted or replayed by an attacker.

### At the Backend (Stage 5)

- **The Integration**: Use the **Recursive Quine Algorithm** to perform **Recursive Acquisition** and auditing on legacy data.
- **The Why**: This transforms "Legacy" data into high-integrity datasets that the AI (at Stage 2) can trust more effectively for its "Intent detect & reasoning."

## Technical Roadmap

- [ ] Transition `recursive_quine_logic` to WASM for edge-computing optimization.
- [ ] Integrate with hardware-secured enclaves for Validator Nodes.
- [ ] Commercial deployment on Sovereign Cloud infrastructure.

## Conclusion

While others provide the **'lock'** (PQC) or the **'key'** (QRNG), our **Qualimetric Universal Model (QUM)** provides the **'Fingerprint'** (**Structural Signature**). We don't just secure the pipe; we use the **Recursive Quine Algorithm** to prove that the data coming out of the AI is structurally identical to the truth anchored in our quantum hardware.
