# 🚀 STARTHERE: Sovereign Passport MVP Quickstart

Welcome to the **Sovereign Passport** implementation suite. This workbook is designed for investors and evaluators to demonstrate the **Qualimetric Universal Model (QUM)** in a live, functional environment.

## 1. Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pip Packages**: `requests` (Required for the notebook)
- **Optional**: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `jinja2` (Required for the full API Gateway Dashboard)

## 2. Navigating the Workbook (`Sovereign_Passport_MVP.ipynb`)

Open the notebook in Jupyter, VS Code, or Google Colab. The cells are sequenced as a narrative flow:

### 🧪 Cell 1: The Quantum Anchor

- **Action**: Run this to sync with the **ANU Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG)**.
- **What to look for**: The `uint16` entropy seed. This is the hardware-rooted "truth" that anchors every passport.

### 🧩 Cell 2: The USP (Recursive Quine Algorithm)

- **Action**: Run the logic engine.
- **What to look for**: Observe the **Recursive Loop**. The algorithm doesn't just hash data; it creates a self-referential **Structural Signature** that binds the AI's intent to the physics-based seed.

### 🛡️ Cell 3: The Governance Boundary (Validation)

- **Action**: Run the simulation.
- **Scenario A (SUCCESS)**: See how the passport grants access when the intent and signature are perfectly aligned.
- **Scenario B (RED TEAM)**: Watch the system reject a tampered request. Even a single bit-flip in the AI's intent causes a signature mismatch.

## 3. The Full Ecosystem (Optional Demo)

If you wish to see the protocol running at scale:

1. Open a terminal in the `sovereign-gateway` folder.
2. Run: `python main.py`
3. Navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) to access the **Quantum Integrity Dashboard**.

## 4. Key Terminology for Evaluators

- **PMI (Polynomial Method Index)**: How we quantify qualitative AI reasoning.
- **Recursive Quine**: Our proprietary "Secret Sauce" logic that enables non-deterministic trust.
- **Integrity Arbitrage**: The economic advantage of QUM—killing hallucinations before they hit the backend.
